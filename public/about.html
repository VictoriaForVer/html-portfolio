<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Victoria, a passionate junior full stack web developer with a knack for creating dynamic, responsive websites and web applications. I enjoy working with both front-end and back-end technologies, combining clean design with efficient functionality to build seamless user experiences. My tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I'm always eager to learn new tools and frameworks.</p>

<p>I love tackling challenges and collaborating on projects that push me to grow as a developer. Whether it's developing intuitive interfaces or building robust APIs, Iâ€™m dedicated to writing clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, working on personal projects, or contributing to open-source.</p>
